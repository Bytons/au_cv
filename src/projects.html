        <p class="flow-text">Tiira 2 is an upcoming update to the national bird information service of Finland,
            <a href="https://www.tiira.fi">Tiira.</a> In Tiira, you can find information about birds, create new observations of birds, and much more.
        </p>
        <p class="flow-text">
            I have worked in the project as a software developer and found it to be a very unique and interesting
            challenge.

        <h4>Project challenges</h4>
        <p class="flow-text">
            Thinking about how a specific kind of bird-watching pro might use the software versus a completely new
            hobbyist for example has been interesting from a design and programming point of view. The system has to be
            simple enough for a novice user,
            but efficient enough for a professional user

            One Click LCA is a life cycle
             and sustainability software in the cloud by <a href="https://www.oneclicklca.com/about-bionova-ltd/">Bionova</a>

        <p class="flow-text">
            I worked as part of a small team of software developers, developing and maintaining One Click LCA. My work
            was mainly focused on the UI and UX side of the software
        </p>
        <p class="flow-text">
            My bachelor's thesis studied how to improve the usability of the software from the point of view of the
            actual users. I interviewed many key users of the platform to gain insight into their needs. From the
            results of the study, we developed few features that were well received by the end users of One Click LCA.

        <h4>Project challenges</h4>
        <p class="flow-text">
            In life cycle assestment, a building project has a lot of information to handle. The key challenges when
            developing One Click LCA for me were
            in managing a usable, yet information capable system. A lot of automating the user's steps with code,
            whilst still keeping the ability to do everything by themselves was a key design feature.
