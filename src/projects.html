        <p class="flow-text">Tiira 2 is an upcoming update to the national bird information service of Finland,
            <a href="https://www.tiira.fi">Tiira.</a> In Tiira, you can find information about birds and their
            conservation status, create new
            observations of birds, and much more.
        </p>
        <p class="flow-text">
            I have worked in the project as a software developer and found it to be a very unique and interesting
            challenge.
        </p>
        <h4>Project challenges</h4>
        <p class="flow-text">
            Thinking about how a bird-watching professional might use the software versus a completely new
            hobbyist has been interesting from a design and programming point of view. The system has to be
            simple enough for a novice user succeed, yet
            efficient enough for a professional user to excel.
        </p>
        <h4>Personal accomplishments</h4>
        <p class="flow-text">
            I developed a complete offline capability to Tiira 2 using service workers. What this means is that the end-users
            are able to use Tiira 2 application offline while
            they are out in the nature bird watching and making observations. The way it works is that the service
            worker in the site works as a sort of proxy between the network traffic and the user's browser.
            The worker caches requests that are made by the page, and only fetches new information from the server when
            the content is stale and not up to date. This means that all requests are served from the cache and network
            simultaneously and only updated if needed. The offline magic comes to play when the user has no network
            connection and the site is still usabled due to the content being cached.
            Requests that post data (for example: new observations) are also cached by the worker, and can be
            replayed when the network connection is back.

            I worked as part of a small team of software developers, developing and maintaining One Click LCA. My work
            was mainly focused on the UI and UX side of the software
        </p>
        <p class="flow-text">
            My bachelor's thesis studied how to improve the usability of the software from the point of view of the
            actual users. I interviewed many key users of the platform to gain insight into their needs. From the
            results of the study, we developed new features that were well received by the end users of One Click LCA.

        <h4>Project challenges</h4>
        <p class="flow-text">
            In life cycle assestment, a building project has a lot of information to handle. The key challenges when
            developing One Click LCA for me were
            in managing a usable, yet information capable system. Automating the user's workload,
            whilst still keeping their ability to tweak everything by themselves was a key design feature.
        </p>

        <h4>Personal accomplishments</h4>
        <p class="flow-text">
            I built a construction material impacts visualisation tool, which helped the end-users notice otherwise
            hard to see errors in their material choices. The feature displays various charts and contextual data from
            the enviromental impacts of chosen materials of their building project.
